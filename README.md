## About Me

Hi, I'm [NitrixEXE](https://discord.gg/qdhKmaqTvg), and I love sharing cool projects I find on GitHub with my audience. My goal is to highlight great work and help others discover useful tools and code.

## About the Project

I recently came across a project created by [GlaceYT] that I think is worth sharing. 

## Credits and Copyright

I want to make it clear that I did not create this project. All credit goes to [GlaceYT]. I'm just sharing it with the help of [snoww.](https://discord.com/users/1092374628556615690) to help spread the word and support the creator.

Thank you for respecting the original creator's work. Let's keep supporting each other and sharing great ideas in the community!
